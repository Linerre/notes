# macOS, Zsh, and more
I'm using different machines with different OSs installed on them. Currently:
1. Windows 10 (Dell);
2. macOS Big Sur (Air);
3. Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, Void Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD (A few Thinkpads)

Yeap, I'm this insane.

## Zsh config
On Windows 10 I just use the default PowerShell. But on macOS and Linux distros, I use zsh, for no special reasons. I have to admit that I made this choice simply because many, many Youtubers I've subscribed to recommend it for reasons 1, 2, 3, ...

The point here is: I want my zsh config to be consistant among both macOS and other Linux distros as well as \*BSD systems. Sounds easy right? As long as I have POSIX style `.zshrc`, it shouldn't be any hard to acheive that boring goal. I was, however, deadly wrong.
